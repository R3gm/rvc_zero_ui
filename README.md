# RVC‚ö°ZERO

## Overview
**RVC Zero** is powered by the **Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC)** framework. It supports both **voice conversion** and **text-to-speech (TTS)**, enabling you to input text or audio and transform it into expressive, high-quality outputs with control over voice characteristics and audio effects.

## Key Functions
1. **Voice Conversion**  
   - Apply RVC to your own audio: upload via drag-and-drop, file selection, or use a URL for model, index, or audio files.  
   - Advanced settings allow fine-grained control over pitch, envelope, breath protection, and more.

2. **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**  
   - Enter text and synthesize speech using available voices (e.g., *English (United States) ‚Äì Emma (Multilingual, Female)*).  
   - Preview playback with ‚ÄúPlay,‚Äù then generate the voice output via ‚ÄúProcess TTS.‚Äù

3. **Advanced Audio Controls**  
   Customize output with parameters like:  
   - **Pitch algorithm** (e.g., *rmvpe+*), **pitch level**, **index influence**,  
   - **Respiration median filtering**, **envelope ratio**, **consonant breath protection**,  
   - **Number of processing steps**, **output format** (e.g., WAV), **denoise**, **reverb**.

4. **Model Upload**  
   - Provide custom RVC model and index files via drag-and-drop or file picker to tailor conversion.

5. **Playback & Download**  
   - Listen to results within the interface and download processed TTS or converted audio outputs.
